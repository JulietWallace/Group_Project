Bootstrap progress bar code in book.html is from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_progressbars.asp

We used the following links to do things with Bootsrap:

https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/

https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp

We also used the Tango with Django textbook that we used for Rango to create more advanced features which included copying code from our rango projects and segments from the book.

This was used for the password validators

We also looked at the official Django tutorial https://www.djangoproject.com.
